Tic Tac Toe in HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Problem Statement:

A simple tic-tac-toe application using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript that runs in the
browser. The UI for the board should be a grid of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each space on the
board is either blank, “X”, or “O”. The application should allow the user to tap a square to
enter their move. “X” should start the game then “O” after which “X” and “O” alternate. After
all spaces on the board are filled, the application should indicate “Game Over” and offer the
user the chance to play again. The game should also have a button to clear the board and
restart the game before the game ends.
The application should focus on code quality and design. It does not need to include any logic
for determining if there is a winner or tie—the user would do this. The application should not
include a backend and not rely on any frameworks (e.g. React, Bootstrap, Angular, Vue, etc.).

Developer's/Solution's Ideal Key Points:

● Ability to design and implement an appropriate architecture.

● Expertise in writing clean, readable, maintainable, extensible, and easily debuggable code.

● Knowledge of JavaScript (use of ES6 is encouraged)

● Proficiency in creating a responsive web design layout.

Usage:

Can be run directly from source by opening up /tictactoe/src/index.html in a browser.

Components:

● HTML5: index.html houses the wrapper for the game component as well as providing basic game functionality (Clear/Restart)

● JS: tictactoe.js contains the entirety of the game logic (can be thought of as a swappable/reusable component).

● CSS: styles.css houses all of the style rules for the site.

Pending To-Dos:

● Unit Testing.

● Debug & fix IE compatibility issues.

● Externalize constants.

● Consider adding media queries for a more responsive layout if more components are planned on being added.

● Minified JS to 'dist' directory - for a distributible package which can then be versioned.
